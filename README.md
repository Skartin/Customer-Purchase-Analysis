# Customer-Purchase-Analysis

Overview:
In this project, we'll analyze a fictional dataset containing information about customer purchases from an e-commerce platform. We'll explore various aspects of the data, including customer demographics, purchase behavior, product popularity, and sales trends.
Dataset:
We have a relational database containing the following tables:
customers: Contains information about customers, including customer ID, name, email, age, gender, and location.
products: Contains information about products, including product ID, name, category, price, and availability.
orders: Contains information about customer orders, including order ID, customer ID, product ID, order date, and quantity.
Objectives:
Explore customer demographics:
Analyze the distribution of customers by age and gender.
Identify the top locations with the highest number of customers.
Analyze purchase behavior:
Calculate total revenue generated from sales.
Determine the average order value.
Identify the most popular products based on sales volume.
Examine sales trends:
Analyze monthly sales trends to identify seasonal patterns.
Calculate the percentage change in sales compared to the previous month.

This sample data exploration project provides insights into customer demographics, purchase behavior, and sales trends. The SQL queries help identify key patterns and metrics that can inform business decisions and strategies for the e-commerce platform. Further analysis and visualization can be performed using BI tools like Tableau or Power BI for more comprehensive insights and reporting.
